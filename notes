ISSUES:
- had problems pushing the image build to gc cluster due to a typo in the image name 
  (standard: eu.gcr.io/..., had 'gcl' instead of 'gcr' and us instead of eu)
- had ticketing.dev in /etc/hosts mapped twice, to gc and localhost

  - jest will hang until timeout and fail the test if the api doesn't send back a response
  - can temporalily change node_modules files directly for debugging (must reverse back!!)
  - if you don't send a status code from api, it defaults to 200

7 Feb 2021
- setting new properties on the model makes updates only to the document in memory does not persist it to mongodb (have to do 'await model.save())

check again:
  - how is the url inside tests get prepended with the cluster domain? (think express automatically adds the url of the server it is currently running on)


10 Feb 2021
  - the kubectl port-forwarding command need to be run in new terminal window, while the pods are running (and provided the pod id of the currently running nats container)

11 Feb 2021
  - setting the queueGroupsName on NATS listener prevents NATS completelly shutting down a client that got temporarily disconected. And also distributes the events randomly among queueGroupsName members

  - connecting to mongodb instances inside kubernetes cluster:
  kubectl exec -it tickets-mongo-depl-685f7f898-tp27w mongo mongodb://localhost:27017/tickets
  kubectl exec -it orders-mongo-depl-86ddbcc7db-zcthl mongo mongodb://localhost:27017/orders


23 Feb 2021
  - to connect to mongodb running on kubernetes cluster, had to:
    kubectl exec -it orders-mongo-depl-7789bdc8b8-jd872 mongo mongodb://localhost:27017/orders
    (or change to 'orders' inside mongo shell by typing 'use orders')
    > show collections
    > db.tickets.find({price: 15}).length()

  - was gettning STDIN error when running skaffold. The error gone away after running:
    kubectl delete -A ValidatingWebhookConfiguration ingress-nginx-admission
    and changing the apiVersion in the ingress manifest file to networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
  more on that here:
  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61365202/nginx-ingress-service-ingress-nginx-controller-admission-not-found

  - it makes a difference where the app.use(customRouter) is declared!!! should be before the catch-all route declaration in the app.js

  6 March
  - how jest mocks know that the particular mocked function has been called, since the tests are running locally and the mocked function is actually running in the cluster..???
  - restarting a single kubernetes pod:
   kubectl rollout restart deployment [deployment_name]


12 March
  - configure git client ssh keys:
    cd ~/.ssh
    ls
    ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/<private key>

13 March
  - selective testing on github workflows wont work if the tests on previous commit (on the existing pull request) have failed
  - git status will not inform you if github is up to date with local commited changes, it only shows status for local changes.
  - git merge from the dev branch into master will bring all the recent changes from master into the dev branch
